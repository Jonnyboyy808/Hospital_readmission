# Hospital_readmission

- The project is available for download as hospital_readmissions.ipynb as a jupyter notebook file. 
- To run the notebook and not just see the output, you should download diabetes_dataset.zip and diabetes.csv also. 
- This project focuses on the length of stay and re-admissions for hospital patients with diabetes. 
- I generated heat maps showing the commonalities of admission source to discharge disposition. 
- Additionally, I regressed the number of days in the hospital on the number of prior visits. 
- Lastly, I used one-hot encoding to make categorical variables numeric. Then, I regressed number of days in the hospital on additional factors, including race, gender, and age.
- Lasty, I used logistic regression to predict whether someone will be readmitted to the hospital 30 days after being released.
